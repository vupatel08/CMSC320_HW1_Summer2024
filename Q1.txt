Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

Hello, My name is Vraj Patel and the reason I always wanted to take 320 is because 1: I want to become a data scientist, 2: it was a major requirement and 3: that I have always thought of myself to be a logical thinker trying to find patterns and correlation between things. I have worked on some DS projects in the past (super small involving only couple columns and rows nothing big) and found them to be super interesting. They are challenging making me think in a different way. I always see myself trying to think out of the box or trying to manipulate the data to find hidden patterns and correlations which I think is super cool and worth me spending hours over. This class also helps me understand what my career would be and if that is something I enjoy or not. Overall, I think DS is a cool field which allows me to think more logically so I want to take this class.
